<h2>Your Wedding</h2>
<p>
<img align="right" src="images/ThisDayCard.jpg" width="314" height="209" class="fltRight">Your 
wedding day has finally arrived.&nbsp; You have been planning for this day for a 
long time.&nbsp; Flowers, guests, decorations, cake, invitations -- you can 
relax and actually enjoy the day because all of the plans are in place.&nbsp; 
Your focus is on your spouse to be, and the new life you will live together.</p>
<p>
This is the way your wedding day truly should be, and it can be.</p>
<p>
A photographer is a vital part of the wedding day planning and the wedding day 
itself.&nbsp; You and your photographer will spend a large amount of time 
together on your wedding day.&nbsp; The photographer will be a near constant 
companion on that special day.&nbsp; You need to assure that you and 
the photographer will work well together.&nbsp; You need to be very selective about 
this person that is going to capture you in some of your most emotional moments.</p>
<p>
This is one of the reasons that we need to meet with you face-to-face.&nbsp; We 
need to talk about your needs and your dream wedding and how you envision it 
taking place.&nbsp; One of the worst things for you to worry about on your 
wedding day is your photographer.&nbsp; The interview process is important to 
assure that we can work with each other.&nbsp; We need to make sure that we 
share a positive chemistry; that is the only way that we can both be happy and 
help make your wedding the special day that you deserve.</p>
<h2>Prior to Wedding</h2>
<p>If you are working with a wedding planner, we would like to contact them very 
early on so that we can learn of every aspect of your wedding.</p>
<p>We prefer to attend your wedding rehearsal.&nbsp; The flow and order of your 
ceremony is important for us to see and understand.&nbsp; We will not 
participate in the rehearsal, but merely want to observe and identify potential 
photographic opportunities.&nbsp; It is your choice if we attend; it is not a 
requirement.</p>
<h2>

<p>After your special day is complete we will meticulously work on every 
photograph.&nbsp; We will deliver your pictures to you as soon as possible.&nbsp; 
In many cases we will deliver your proofs in just over one month, but please 
allow for more time especially if your wedding has resulted in a large quantity 
of pictures.</p>
<p>If you are ordering an <a href="../packages.asp?page=albums.htm">album</a> 
(either as part of a package or separately) then we will want to identify some 
of the special pictures that you want in your album so we can create your 
one-of-a-kind photographic memory book.&nbsp; Please allow additional time 
for us to create your album.</p>
<h2><img align="right" alt="Signature Photographs" src="images/IMG_5325b.jpg" class="fltRight" width="166" height="250">Signature Photographs</h2>
<p>
Some of the packages include special processing for our Signature 
Photographs.&nbsp; For these special images we will spend several hours on each 
picture.&nbsp; Each Signature Photograph is unique and will capture a special 
moment in the story of your wedding.</p>
