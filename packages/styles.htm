	<img alt="Traditional" align="left" height="160" src="images/100_0022.JPG" width="120" style="left: 0px; top: 0px" class="fltLeft">Traditional</h2>
	<p>
	Characterized by its highly posed and formal imagery, the traditional style 
	most frequently involves shots which are &quot;set up&quot; before being taken.&nbsp; 
	This style involves a list of <a href="../packages.asp?page=poses.htm">standard poses</a> from which the bride and groom 
	choose.&nbsp; This is a very classic style that is not fully utilized in the 
	modern event photo shoot.</p>
	<h2>
	<img align="right" alt="Illustrative" height="202" src="images/IMG_4585.JPG" width="161" class="fltRight">Illustrative</h2>
	<p>A largely contemporary form of event photography, this style utilizes the 
	event participants more as design elements.&nbsp; Placing the subjects in 
	unusual settings and approaching the pictures from different angles, this 
	style is typically an art form for the photographer and is more spontaneous 
	than traditional.</p>
	<h2>
	<img align="left" alt="Photojournalism" src="images/IMG_2389b.JPG" class="fltLeft" width="199" height="133">Photojournalism</h2>
	<p>Using this style we capture the event as a series of spontaneous, unposed, 
	shots that document the event.&nbsp; Primarily because of its highly 
	impromptu form and style this is a very popular form with today's modern 
	couples.</p>
	<h2>
	<img align="right" alt="Fine Art" src="images/IMG_8101a.JPG" class="fltRight" width="160" height="134">Fine Art</h2>
	<p>Giving the photographer full creative expression, the Fine Art form 
	is best known for its inventive use of lighting effects and angles.&nbsp; 
	Highly stylized imagery characterize the event photographs.&nbsp; Images 
	frequently appear more as works of art or paintings, rather than 
	photographs.&nbsp; This style requires quite a bit of commitment from the 
	participants.</p>
	<h2>
	<img align="left" alt="High Fashion" src="images/IMG_8099b.JPG" class="fltLeft" width="134" height="200">High Fashion</h2>
	<p>A marriage of techniques typically used by the fashion 
	industry with photojournalism, this style often depicts the participants 
	(especially the primary participants) as if they have just stepped from the 
	pages of a fashion magazine.</p>

We typically use a mix of Traditional, 
	Photojournalism, Illustrative and Fine Art to capture your event.&nbsp; The 
	amount of mix between styles is determined by YOU.</p>
